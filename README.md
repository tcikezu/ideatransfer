# idea transfer 

To run simulations, simply run 'python3 simulation.py'
However, the following are some dependencies:
- python3.7
- ipython3
- pickle
- numpy
- matplotlib
- mpl_toolkits
- datetime
- random
- collections

In addition to this, running all the code under jupyter notebooks is recommended. 

After running simulation.py, several variables are saved with pickle, to form a pkl file.
(Name depends on the value for variable 'fn', set in simulation.py)
This pkl file, is can then be used in a variety of contexts -- see for e.g., plotStuff.ipynb

Within plotStuff.ipynb, one can generate gifs of the agents attempting to convince the entire community of their idea. See the gifs folder for example gifs.
