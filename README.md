# ideatransfer
Deterministic and probabilistic spreading of merging of ideas.
Ideas will merge if beyond threshold, ideas will drift apart if not.
If probabilistic, then chance of two ideas merging depends on member position distance.
Otherwise, everybody interacts with everyone else at every time step.

For the probabilistic simulation, used gamma = 0.008, T = 200
For the deterministic simulation, used gamma = 0.001, T = 200

For both, numberMembers = 300, numberIdeas = 3 (to see in 3d plot)
