There are spikes in the probability distributions over idea values. This is good! It means they're learning biases.

Something I should note, is that because I am re-normalizing the probability densities every single iteration, what is happening is that previous beliefs are being long-forgotten.    


gifs with ideas, positions, and 1st idea distribution of member 0:

1 -- somewhat uniform, perhaps too far away from cluster?
2 -- also somewhat uniform until near the end of simulation, dist seems to freeze
3 -- relatively fast convergence, but this one's radius is very small
4 -- this one is pretty cool, it momentarily forgets all its beliefs, but quickly regains them once it rejoins a cluster
5 -- again a really damn small radius; ideas hardly change; i guess it's a consequence of not interacting with others much
6 -- oh interesting, this member is *extremely* fast, and idea dist became biased pretty quickly
7 -- same as 5. small radius
8 -- can see a nearly bimodal distribution over ideas. big radius seems to help
9 -- this one is also really cool. member 0 trails off to the bottom right with some neighbors. This shows the effect of having few neighbors; the ideas seem to have much higher variance.
10 -- this seems to be a classic case of idea distribution converging to cluster distribution
11 -- interesting -- member 0 idea idst pretty stable with what appears to be <10 neighbors
12 -- another classic case of idea death // not enough in the cluster to keep ideas alive
