probabilistic 1 and 2 used:
community(numberMembers=100,numberIdeas=3,domainSize=10)
gamma=0.05, T = 200, 

deterministic used the same parameters.

In the deterministic case, members fly away from each other. 
It seems like, constantly having to interact with everybody means they receive momentum
at all times, to move away from one another. Interesting -- so it is expected.

Probabilistic case, there are spikes in the probability distributions over idea values. This is good! It means they're learning biases.

Something I should note, is that because I am re-normalizing the probability densities every single iteration, what is happening is that previous beliefs are being long-forgotten.    


gifs with ideas, positions, and 1st idea distribution of member 0:

1 -- member 0 is caught in a tangle with just one other member. dist converges to uniform
2 -- member 0 is caught in a cluster. dist converges to 1 spike
3 -- ""
4 -- like 2, but the spike is not as peaked
5 -- initially bimodal, but one idea is bit more dominant than rest
7 -- this one is far away from the rest -- I wonder if its threshold is low, because its distribution converges to uniform. Not being in cluster seems to predict low bias.
8 -- like 2, is caught in cluster, ideas seem frozen
9 -- this one is really cool -- member 0 is far away from everyone else, but is very biased
10 -- this one is also really cool -- someone starts off somewhat far apart, but eventually becomes very un-biased. Maybe gamma should be diminishing with time.
11 -- somewhat uniform,
