information maximization
social media / text analysis, how language use change over time
-- how language feature of user change over time
--idea user life cycle: begin posting, eventually leave / stop. identify change in linguistic feature over a life cycle
-- at first a learning phase, in which user adopts language of community; a conservative phase where they stop changing, and community passes them by
preferential attachment (how model grows)
---> leads to power law of weights and can explain six degrees of separation

2d vs 3d
uniform initializations
Not sure why normalization doesn't allow plot to just ... stay between -1 and 1? This is the case for scatter3d too. I ought to run simulate.py in ipython3 if I really want to see what's up.

Also, what does this rotation mean? maybe relative ideas matter but ... yeah it's kind of hard to believe this model if ideas are rotation invariant.
